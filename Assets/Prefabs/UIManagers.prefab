  - "Uh, hello... it's me again. Sorry to bother you, but the noise from your place
    has been REALLY loud lately\u2014just now there was another huge crash. Are you...
    renovating?"
  - "But it\u2019s already nighttime... Hmm? What\u2019s that smell? Did something
    burn?"
  - "\u2026\u2026Right. Well, could you keep it down next time? I work night shifts
    and only get to sleep in the afternoon. "
  BSentences:
  - "Ah! Yes, yes, renovations! I'm just... reorganizing my bookshelf. You know how
    it is with old houses\u2014things tend to topple over when they get too cluttered.
    Ha-ha. Maybe the cat knocked over a vase? I\u2019ll go scold it later."
  - "NIGHTTIME\uFF01\uFF1FI\u2014uh, I\u2019m making soup! Thick soup! The ingredients
    are... rare. Yeah, slow-cooking takes a while\u2014"
  - Of course, of course! Here, have a homemade cookie as an apology? So sorry about
    this! (whispering quickly) *Eatethisandforget eatethisandforget*......
